        "description": "In a scene towards the end of the novel, Lily visits a restaurant to get out of the cold. Her social and economic status is at its lowest, and this visit to a restaurant is a splurge for her. </br></br>Wharton doesn't explicitly compare this restaurant to the  restaurants she would have visited earlier in the novel, when she had access to more money (or at least, more credit). The white tablecloths and the location suggest that it seems luxurious to her in comparison to her boarding house. However, the detail that the \"sallow preoccupied\" women are hurrying through their tea might indicate that they are still working women (or at the very least, not women of extreme leisure like Lily's old friends). ",
        "quote": "\"Lily walked up Fifth Avenue toward the Park, hoping to find a sheltered nook where she might sit; but the wind chilled her, and after an hour’s wandering under the tossing boughs she yielded to her increasing weariness, and took refuge in a little restaurant in Fifty-ninth Street. She was not hungry, and had meant to go without luncheon; but she was too tired to return home, and the long perspective of white tables showed alluringly through the windows.</br></br>The room was full of women and girls, all too much engaged in the rapid absorption of tea and pie to remark her entrance. ...the sallow preoccupied women, with their bags and note-books and rolls of music, were all engrossed in their own affairs, and even those who sat by themselves were busy running over proof-sheets or devouring magazines between their hurried gulps of tea.\"",

She is described as living \"half a mile\" from 50th and 5th, which  would place her just a block north of the little restaurant where Lily stops only a few pages before. Wharton's geography is likely very loose here -- based on the actual locations of Gilded Era mansions, people like the Dorsets would have likely lived further north.",
        "quote": "She had allowed herself time to walk to Mrs. Dorset’s, thinking that the quick movement through the cold evening air would help to steady her nerves; but she really felt no need of being tranquillized. Her survey of the situation remained calm and unwavering.\n\nAs she reached Fiftieth Street the clouds broke abruptly, and a rush of cold rain slanted into her face. She had no umbrella and the moisture quickly penetrated her thin spring dress. She was still half a mile from her destination, and she decided to walk across to Madison Avenue and take the electric car.",

The Benedick was not a real building (though it represents a typical type of building where a bachelor of Selden's status would live), and if it had been real, it likely would have been located elsewhere.

Toward the end of the novel, it is Nettie who offers Lily charity, even though Nettie is working class herself.\n\nNettie lives \"three blocks\" from Bryant Park. Contemporary readers might have known which direction that was likely to be. To make an educated guess, I consulted an 1880 neighborhood map via Mapping Historical New York, a project sponsored by Columbia University.  I placed Nettie on the most densely populated block that fit Wharton's description. People with a variety of working-class professions (garment workers, laborers, etc.) lived on the block at the time. ",

You see, it’s my husband’s night-shift—he’s a motor-man—and the friend I leave the baby with has to step upstairs to get HER husband’s supper at seven. I didn’t tell you I had a baby, did I? She’ll be four months old day after tomorrow, and to look at her you wouldn’t think I’d ever had a sick day. I’d give anything to show you the baby, Miss Bart, and we live right down the street here—it’s only three blocks off.” [Nettie] lifted her eyes tentatively to Lily’s face, and then added with a burst of courage: “Why won’t you get right into the cars and come home with me while I get baby’s supper? It’s real warm in our kitchen, and you can rest there, and I’ll take YOU home as soon as ever she drops off to sleep.”\"\n",

        "description": "Simon Rosedale is the only Jewish character in The House of Mirth; most of Wharton's other characters regard him with implicit antisemitism (as does, arguably, Wharton herself). His rise in society contrasts with Lily's fall, and the welcome he eventually receives from the people who mocked him before demonstrates how focused on wealth and status Lily's former friends are. (Notably, he is one of the only people from her \"old\" life to show courtesy toward her at the end of the novel -- when she is unwell, he walks her home to her boarding house and offers financial help.)\n\nWhen he \"makes it,\" he builds a grand house. While I think it's more likely that it would be further south, I chose to place him at the site of the Warburg mansion, which was (I believe) the first 5th Avenue mansion built for a Jewish owner. This is a bit of an anachronism -- Felix Warburg built his mansion in 1908, three years after the novel was published -- but Warburg likely faced the same prejudices in real life as the fictional Mr. Rosedale did in novel.",

I was able to make an educated guess about the location of Lily's chemist  (as well as her apartment  -- see other note) based on the fact that she meets Rosedale as she's leaving it. Rosedale is descending from the 6th Avenue train. Lily passes the chemist on the way to her apartment, which I've located on West 42nd -- see that marker for my reasoning.  ",
        "quote": "\"But what she dreaded most of all was having to pass the chemist’s at the corner of Sixth Avenue. She had meant to take another street: she had usually done so of late. But today her steps were irresistibly drawn toward the flaring plate-glass corner; she tried to take the lower crossing, but a laden dray crowded her back, and she struck across the street obliquely, reaching the sidewalk just opposite the chemist’s door.\n\n...In her confusion she stumbled against a man who was hurrying down the last steps of the elevated station. He drew back, and she heard her name uttered with surprise. It was Rosedale, fur-coated, glossy and prosperous—but why did she seem to see him so far off, and as if through a mist of splintered crystals?\"",

Part of Mrs. Mingott's eccentricity is that she chooses to live so far north, and it's telling of her high social status that people still make the journey to visit her.  However, the neighborhood would no longer be considered remote by the turn of the century. \n\nI placed her on this block largely because of something I noticed when I was reading a blog post from the Jewish Museum about the Warburg Mansion (see Simon Rosedale's home). The writer notes that the area had once been remote and, by New York City standards, bucolic -- and to illustrate, they share a passage about Mrs. Mingott's home! It felt appropriate to situate her next door to Mr. Rosedale, albeit 30 years earlier. The change this represents -- the transition from \"old\" to \"new\" money, Rosedale's ability to enter \"high society\" as a Jewish man -- seems fitting, given the novel's theme of changing mores and values over time.",
        "quote": "\n\"A visit to Mrs. Manson Mingott was always an amusing episode to the young man. The house in itself was already an historic document, though not, of course, as venerable as certain other old family houses in University Place and lower Fifth Avenue. Those were of the purest 1830, with a grim harmony of cabbage-rose-garlanded carpets, rosewood consoles, round-arched fire-places with black marble mantels, and immense glazed book-cases of mahogany; whereas old Mrs. Mingott, who had built her house later, had bodily cast out the massive furniture of her prime, and mingled with the Mingott heirlooms the frivolous upholstery of the Second Empire.\n...Mrs. Manson Mingott screwed up her little mouth into a grimace of mimic prudery and twinkled at him through malicious lids. '...When I built this house you'd have thought I was moving to California! Nobody ever HAD built above Fortieth Street—no, says I, nor above the Battery either, before Christopher Columbus discovered America.

        "description": "Countess Olenska lives in a part of 23rd Street that we might now consider \"gentrifying,\" with its mix of workers and artists. It's worth noting that Wharton herself was born on 23rd Street, though she places Madame Olenska much further west. I guessed about the location of Madame Olenska's apartment based on historical details and Galt and Hoy's \"Map of the City of New York,\" published in 1879. I chose a block with a mix of buildings, including one with a garden, for Mme. Olenska's flat -- it seems like the type of place she'd find charming, despite her dislike (echoing Wharton's own) for the \"ugliness\" of New York.",
        "quote": "\"The Countess Olenska had said \"after five\"; and at half after the hour Newland Archer rang the bell of the peeling stucco house with a giant wisteria throttling its feeble cast-iron balcony, which she had hired, far down West Twenty-third Street, from the vagabond Medora.\n\nIt was certainly a strange quarter to have settled in. Small dress-makers, bird-stuffers and \"people who wrote\" were her nearest neighbours; and further down the dishevelled street Archer recognised a dilapidated wooden house, at the end of a paved path, in which a writer and journalist called Winsett, whom he used to come across now and then, had mentioned that he lived. Winsett did not invite people to his house; but he had once pointed it out to Archer in the course of a nocturnal stroll, and the latter had asked himself, with a little shiver, if the humanities were so meanly housed in other capitals.\"",

Wharton placed it on East 39th, where today there are no traces of \"ghastly greenish-yellow stone\" townhouses, if they ever existed at all. I consulted \"Mapping Historical New York\" to find a block that fit. The further east you go, the more working class the neighborhood got, so I placed them close to Park, though I would need to learn a lot more about the history of New York to know if that would be \"remote\" enough to match Wharton's description. In 1880, there's at least one lawyer living on this block, so I gave Archer -- a lawyer himself -- his house.",

He knew that Mr. Welland, who was behaving 'very handsomely,' already had his eye on a newly built house in East Thirty-ninth Street. The neighbourhood was thought remote, and the house was built in a ghastly greenish-yellow stone that the younger architects were beginning to employ as a protest against the brownstone of which the uniform hue coated New York like a cold chocolate sauce; but the plumbing was perfect.\"",

Based on other context, the only el stops that fit are 23rd St., 33rd St., 42nd St., or 50th. (Others opened after the novel was written.)\n\nKnowing that Wharton was born on 23rd and chooses to make far West 23rd the home of Madame Olenska's artistic neighborhood in \"The Age of Innocence,\" I believe we can eliminate the possibility of Lily living on or near 23rd. like it can only be 50th, 42nd, or 33rd (other 6th Avenue line stations opened after the novel was written). Demographics maps show that 50th was less densely populated further to the west, which makes it an unlikely location for a shabby boarding house. 42nd and 33rd were both dense -- but given the landmarks near 42nd, and the fact that it's closer to Bryant Park, which has been mentioned before as a place where Lily stops at this point in her life, I believe that 42nd is the most likely spot for her to run into Rosedale.\n\nAccording to <a href=\"https://mappinghny.com\">Mapping Historical New York</a>, this block is the first one on 42nd west of 6th that has a significant number of garment workers living there in 1880; it and the blocks directly South are very densely populated, compared to the blocks to the east. 42nd St. has a large population of immigrants at that time, but from various backgrounds, whereas the strets to the south are predominantly German -- something I think would have been noted if Wharton had intended it to be the case about Lily's street.",
        "quote": "\"Lily uttered no protest, and when he had paused to make sure of his change they emerged from the hotel and crossed Sixth Avenue again. As she led the way westward past a long line of areas which, through the distortion of their paintless rails, revealed with increasing candour the <i>disjecta membra</a> of bygone dinners, Lily felt that Rosedale was taking contemptuous note of the neighbourhood; and before the doorstep at which she finally paused he looked up with an air of incredulous disgust.\n\n'This isn’t the place? Some one told me you were living with Miss Farish.'\n\n'No: I am boarding here. I have lived too long on my friends.'\n\nHe continued to scan the blistered brown stone front, the windows draped with discoloured lace, and the Pompeian decoration of the muddy vestibule; then he looked back at her face and said with a visible effort: 'You’ll let me come and see you some day?'\"",

He helped establish several small public parks in tenement neighborhoods, including Hamilton Fish Park, which opened on Rivington Street in 1900.",

        "description": "Bandits’ Roost, a Lower East Side haunt in an Italian enclave on Mulberry Street, was mostly inhabited by immigrants exploited by excessive rents in decrepit tenements that Riis called “the vilest and worst to be found anywhere.” Riis worked with amateur photographers to capture this infamous alley and a group of delinquent youth with a stereoscopic camera (which generated two side-by-side images). In 1888, Riis tracked the death rates on Baxter and Mulberry streets. That year, the city’s general death rate was 26%, while Mulberry Street doubled the rate at 38%. Discrimination, desperation, and poverty led to the rise of an underground economy, vice, and organized crime in immigrant neighborhoods. Poor children were especially trapped between their guardians, parents, and employers as their labor was claimed, formally or informally, for both household incomes and private profits. Riis ultimately led other progressive reformers in a ten-year crusade to clean up the infamous “Mulberry Bend.” ",

        "description": "In this image, Riis captured the blind residents in a tenement owned by a blind landlord, Daniel Murphy, at 26 Cherry Street on the Lower East Side. The development of modern supports for the visually impaired were in the infancy in the progressive era. Riis aimed to capture images that would generate compassion and thereby support for reform. As Riis reported in How the Other Half Lives, the alley gained its infamous name because “its dark burrows harbored a colony of blind beggars.” According to Riis, Murphy claimed to have acquired $400,000 in profits from his alley and the surrounding tenements. Riis reported, “Even when the Board of Health at last compelled Murphy to repair and clean up the worst of his old buildings, the work was accomplished against the old man’s angry protests.” In contrast, Riis wrote that the residents of the “sunless and joyless” alley could look forward to a yearly visit from a municipal official distributing their meager share of the city’s $20,000 in public assistance. Despite desperate conditions, “That night it is noisy with unwonted merriment,” Riis remarked, “There is scraping of squeaky fiddles in the dark rooms, and cracked old voices sing long-forgotten songs.” Despite the city’s efforts, the alley remained decrypt and dangerous, which Riis experienced firsthand. In taking a flashlight photograph, necessary to illuminate the dingy conditions, Riis accidentally set a tenement attic room ablaze. Riis and six blind residents were faced with navigating “a dozen crooked, rickety stairs” to reach safety on the street. In the end, he managed to put out the fire, but it was “a vast deal of trouble.” When Riis reported the incident to a police officer afterward, “he thought it rather a good joke” and explained that “It caught fire six times last winter, but it wouldn’t burn” because the “dirt was so thick on the walls, it smothered the fire!”",

This image captured boarders at a tenement in “the Bend” district between Broadway, Canal, and Chatham Streets. In How the Other Half Lives, Riis reported, only nine “apartments” were vacant out of 4,367 in the neighborhood, but that the “vast homeless crowds” made it impossible for public officials to complete an accurate census. According to Riis, the tenement room in the photograph was “not thirteen feet either way” and “slept twelve men and women, two or three in the bunks… the rest on the floor.” In words and images, Riis captured the “fearful atmosphere” of a kerosene lamp burning dimly amidst “a baby’s fretful wail” and shadowy figures fidgeting in the darkness. Riis also lamented the limited impact of health officers “scattering disinfectants in the streets and lanes, in sinks and cellars, and hidden hovels where the tramp burrows.” “From midnight till far into the small hours of the morning,” Riis asserted, “the policeman’s thundering rap on closed doors is heard… on his rounds gathering evidence of overcrowding.”",

Despite his somewhat elitist pretensions about the man’s idleness, Riis respected that “He knew his rights and the value of ‘work,’ and was not to be cheated out of either.”",

In contrast to his seven-cent beds, “He lived in a handsome house quite near to the stylish precincts of Murray Hill, where the nature of his occupation was not suspected.”",
