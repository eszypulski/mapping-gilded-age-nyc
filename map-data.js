        "description": "In a scene towards the end of the novel, Lily visits a restaurant to get out of the cold. Her social and economic status is at its lowest, and this visit to a restaurant is a splurge for her. </br></br>Wharton doesn't explicitly compare this restaurant to the  restaurants she would have visited earlier in the novel, when she had access to more money (or at least, more credit). The white tablecloths and the location suggest that it seems luxurious to her in comparison to her boarding house. However, the detail that the \"sallow preoccupied\" women are hurrying through their tea might indicate that they are still working women (or at the very least, not women of extreme leisure like Lily's old friends). ",
        "quote": "\"Lily walked up Fifth Avenue toward the Park, hoping to find a sheltered nook where she might sit; but the wind chilled her, and after an hour’s wandering under the tossing boughs she yielded to her increasing weariness, and took refuge in a little restaurant in Fifty-ninth Street. She was not hungry, and had meant to go without luncheon; but she was too tired to return home, and the long perspective of white tables showed alluringly through the windows.</br></br>The room was full of women and girls, all too much engaged in the rapid absorption of tea and pie to remark her entrance. ...the sallow preoccupied women, with their bags and note-books and rolls of music, were all engrossed in their own affairs, and even those who sat by themselves were busy running over proof-sheets or devouring magazines between their hurried gulps of tea.\"",

          "description": "Bertha Dorset, who spreads the rumors and gossip that contribute to Lily's downfall, is meant to be quite wealthy. She is described as living \"half a mile\" from 50th and 5th, which  would place her just a block north of the little restaurant where Lily stops only a few pages before. Wharton's geography is likely very loose here -- based on the actual locations of Gilded Era mansions, people like the Dorsets would have likely lived further north.",
          "quote": "She had allowed herself time to walk to Mrs. Dorset’s, thinking that the quick movement through the cold evening air would help to steady her nerves; but she really felt no need of being tranquillized. Her survey of the situation remained calm and unwavering.\n\nAs she reached Fiftieth Street the clouds broke abruptly, and a rush of cold rain slanted into her face. She had no umbrella and the moisture quickly penetrated her thin spring dress. She was still half a mile from her destination, and she decided to walk across to Madison Avenue and take the electric car.",

      "description": "Lily's would-be beau, Lawrence Selden, lives in the Benedick on 50th Street. The Benedick was not a real building (though it represents a typical type of building where a bachelor of Selden's status would live), and if it had been real, it likely would have been located elsewhere. This address is right across the street from St. Patrick's Cathedral, which Lily would likely have noted. Another reminder that Wharton was living in Lenox, Massachuttsetts at the time she wrote this novel.",
      "quote": "As she turned into the side street, a vague memory stirred in her. The row of budding trees, the new brick and limestone house-fronts, the Georgian flat-house with flower-boxes on its balconies, were merged together into the setting of a familiar scene. It was down this street that she had walked with Selden, that September day two years ago; a few yards ahead was the doorway they had entered together.",

      "nickname": "Nettie Struther's Apartment",
      "description": "As part of her charitable work when Lily was wealthy, she paid for a woman named Nettie Struther to recover from disease at a sanitorium upstate. Toward the end of the novel, it is Nettie who offers Lily charity, even though Nettie is working class herself.\n\nNettie lives \"three blocks\" from Bryant Park. Contemporary readers might have known which direction that was likely to be. To make an educated guess, I consulted an 1880 neighborhood map via Mapping Historical New York, a project sponsored by Columbia University.  I placed Nettie on the most densely populated block that fit Wharton's description. People with a variety of working-class professions (garment workers, laborers, etc.) lived on the block at the time. ",
      "quote": "\n\n“Oh, but I can’t leave you like this—you’re not fit to go home alone. And I can’t go with you either!... You see, it’s my husband’s night-shift—he’s a motor-man—and the friend I leave the baby with has to step upstairs to get HER husband’s supper at seven. I didn’t tell you I had a baby, did I? She’ll be four months old day after tomorrow, and to look at her you wouldn’t think I’d ever had a sick day. I’d give anything to show you the baby, Miss Bart, and we live right down the street here—it’s only three blocks off.” [Nettie] lifted her eyes tentatively to Lily’s face, and then added with a burst of courage: “Why won’t you get right into the cars and come home with me while I get baby’s supper? It’s real warm in our kitchen, and you can rest there, and I’ll take YOU home as soon as ever she drops off to sleep.”\"\n",

      "description": "Simon Rosedale is the only Jewish character in The House of Mirth; most of Wharton's other characters regard him with implicit antisemitism (as does, arguably, Wharton herself). His rise in society contrasts with Lily's fall, and the welcome he eventually receives from the people who mocked him before demonstrates how focused on wealth and status Lily's former friends are. (Notably, he is one of the only people from her \"old\" life to show courtesy toward her at the end of the novel -- when she is unwell, he walks her home to her boarding house and offers financial help.)\n\nWhen he \"makes it,\" he builds a grand house. While I think it's more likely that it would be further south, I chose to place him at the site of the Warburg mansion, which was (I believe) the first 5th Avenue mansion built for a Jewish owner. This is a bit of an anachronism -- Felix Warburg built his mansion in 1908, three years after the novel was published -- but Warburg likely faced the same prejudices in real life as the fictional Mr. Rosedale did in novel.",
