            <p>Lily's would-be beau, Lawrence Selden, lives in the Benedick on 50th Street. The Benedick was not a real building (though it represents a typical type of building where a bachelor of Selden's status would live), and if it had been real, it likely would have been located elsewhere. This address is right across the street from St. Patrick's Cathedral, which Lily would likely have noted. Another reminder that Wharton was living in Lenox, Massachuttsetts at the time she wrote this novel. </p>

                "As she turned into the side street, a vague memory stirred in her. The row of budding trees, the new brick and limestone house-fronts, the Georgian flat-house with flower-boxes on its balconies, were merged together into the setting of a familiar scene. It was down this street that she had walked with Selden, that September day two years ago; a few yards ahead was the doorway they had entered together."
