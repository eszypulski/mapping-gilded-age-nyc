    <h1>About this Project</h1>
    <h3>Placing this work in the Gilded Age</h3>
    <P>This project is an attempt to map the works of two chroniclers of Gilded Age New York: Edith Wharton and Jacob Riis. Both offered clear-eyed critiques of the city and its people, and together they represent the duality inherent to the idea of a Gilded Age. Wharton’s novels describe the thin ornamental gilding that conceals the truth about a society; Riis’ journalism and photography deal with with what’s rotten underneath. Wharton’s critique is cultural and relatively narrow: the shallowness of the rich and the rigidity and provincialism of their customs and mores. By contrast, Riis’ critique is material, and his focus on the indigent is an indictment of the wider social and economic structures of late 19th century New York. </P>
    <p>I was inspired to map Wharton and Riis after a visit to the <a href="https://www.tenement.org">Tenement Museum</a> in New York City. I had read three novels by Wharton in the previous year, and while I’ve always been moved by the photography of Jacob Riis, I hadn’t consciously connected their work until paging through a copy of <em>How the Other Half Lives</em> while waiting for my tour.</p>

       <p>"How the Other Half Lives": The title alone is pointed, and I couldn’t help but think of Riis directing it toward New Yorkers who resemble Wharton’s characters. They possess such precise, detailed knowledge about the rules of their own limited world, yet show so little curiosity about what exists just out of sight. By mapping sites from Wharton’s novels and Riis’ journalism, I hoped to see just how closely these worlds were situated.</p>

    <p>I was particularly interested in spatially distinguishing the “genteel” poverty experienced by some of Wharton’s characters from the desperate circumstances Riis documented. For example, Wharton’s The House of Mirth tells the story of Lily Bart’s gradual fall from “high society” to poverty and obscurity. When Lily, finally broke, moves to a boarding house and works in a small workshop making hats, just how far is she — economically, socially, and literally — from the immigrant garment makers in the tenements of the Lower East Side?</p>

    <h1>Mapping the Unknown</h1>
    <p>approach to mapping - abstracted tiles. antecedents - tenement maps</p>
    <h3>Gathering Data</h3>
    <P>I drew source material from three of Wharton's novels:</P>
<ul>
        <li><em>The House of Mirth</em> (1905), which is set at the end of 19th century  </li>
       <li><em>The Custom of the Country</em> (1913), set in the early 20th century</li> 
        <li><em>The Age of Innocence</em> (1920), set over a generation before, in the 1870s</li>
      </ul>
<p>I also explored Riis's words and photos via:
    <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/jacob-riis/index.html">“Jacob Riis: Revealing How the Other Half Lives”,</a> a virtual exhibition from the Library of Congress</li>
   
            <li>Riis’ book, <em><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/45502/45502-h/45502-h.htm">How the Other Half Lives</a></em> (1890)</li>
    </ul>
<p>Once I had my basic data, I started working to pinpoint precise locations for each place. This was fairly straightforward for Riis’ work, as he was a journalist by trade. For most of his photos and descriptions, I was able to use details in the text to easily estimate the location within a block or two.</p>

    <p>Wharton presented a number of challenges. Most obviously, her work is fiction — so I didn’t expect an exact concurrence between her work and the New York City map. However, a few of her idiosyncrasies made my job harder:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Wharton only rarely used real places (the Academy of Music, the Metropolitan Museum of Art), but she often used buildings that are meant to be stand-ins for other, well-known buildings. For example, Undine Spragg’s hotel in <em>The Custom of the Country</em> is called the Stentorian. Since Wharton provides the cross streets, I know that it’s a stand-in for a real hotel called the Majestic —  and her readers probably would have known that too, and understood that she was using that detail to further color Undine’s character. I have the strong suspicion that many of her other locations —  especially the most ostentatious mansions —  are nods at specific buildings, as well. Contemporary readers would be able to pick up these cues (and so might experts  on the history of New York architecture), but it wasn’t something I could figure out in the ten hours or so I spent collecting this data.</li>
     <li>While each of these novels is set in New York City, Wharton mainly wrote them while living in Lenox, Massachusetts. Even when she provides an exact address, it’s not clear that one should really expect that address to be accurate. For example, in <em>The House of Mirth</em>, Wharton provides us the exact cross streets for Lawrence Selden’s apartment building, “The Benedick.” (Another fictional but very likely-sounding location!) When Lily Bart visits, she notices every detail about her potential beau’s block — except for the fact that it contains St. Patrick’s Cathedral, if it is where Wharton says it is. </li>

    </ul>
    <p>When I reached the limits of what the text could offer, my next step was to consult other sources. The one I used the most was <a href="https://mappinghny.com/?lng=-73.9760&amp;lat=40.7220&amp;zoom=12.50&amp;maps=%5B%7B%22center%22%3A%7B%22lng%22%3A-73.976,%22lat%22%3A40.722%7D,%22demographicOpacity%22%3A1,%22demographicsFilters%22%3A%7B%7D,%22filters%22%3A%7B%7D,%22layers%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22dwellings-dot-density-birthplace%22%7D%5D,%22rasterOpacity%22%3A1,%22year%22%3A%221880%22,%22zoom%22%3A12.5%7D%5D&amp;rasterOpacity0=1">Mapping Historical New York</a>. When Wharton’s text offered me a general area, I used the demographics maps, as well as other historical sources, to come up with a likely location. </p>
    <p>For example, one of the places I was most interested in locating was Lily Bart’s boarding house<em> </em>in <em>The House of Mirth</em>. This is a significant location because of what it represents: Lily’s fall into poverty after she accrues an overwhelming amount of debt and makes “bad” social choices. The boarding house is where Lily goes to live when she decides to stop accepting acquaintances’ charity; it’s also where she dies from an ambiguous overdose. When the other characters see Lily’s living situation, they are shocked and even disgusted. Here’s one reaction:</p>
    <blockquote><p>As she led the way westward past a long line of areas which, through the distortion of their paintless rails, revealed with increasing candour the <em>disjecta membra </em>of bygone dinners, Lily felt that Rosedale was taking contemptuous note of the neighbourhood; and before the doorstep at which she finally paused he looked up with an air of incredulous disgust. </p><p>“This isn’t the place? Some one told me you were living with Miss Farish.” </p><p>“No: I am boarding here. I have lived too long on my friends.” He continued to scan the blistered brown stone front, the windows draped with discoloured lace, and the Pompeian decoration of the muddy vestibule; then he looked back at her face and said with a visible effort: “You’ll let me come and see you some day?””</p><cite>The House of Mirth, Chapter 10</cite></blockquote>

    <p>Given the intensity of Rosedale’s reaction, I was extremely curious about where Lily might have lived — and how it would have compared to the living conditions of immigrants in the tenements. Fortunately, this same section of the novel offered key clues to the location. To put everything together, I consulted <a href="https://mappinghny.com/?lng=-73.9760&amp;lat=40.7220&amp;zoom=12.50&amp;maps=%5B%7B%22center%22%3A%7B%22lng%22%3A-73.976,%22lat%22%3A40.722%7D,%22demographicOpacity%22%3A1,%22demographicsFilters%22%3A%7B%7D,%22filters%22%3A%7B%7D,%22layers%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22dwellings-dot-density-birthplace%22%7D%5D,%22rasterOpacity%22%3A1,%22year%22%3A%221880%22,%22zoom%22%3A12.5%7D%5D&amp;rasterOpacity0=1">Mapping Historical New York</a>, as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRT_Sixth_Avenue_Line">information about the elevated rail line</a> that existed at the time. Interestingly, this location for Lily’s boarding house puts her only a few blocks north of one of the Jacob Riis locations in Hell’s Kitchen — but based on demographics at the time, that was a meaningful distance. The location suggests that while Lily was poor, she was still in not nearly as dire straits as the New Yorkers who lived in the tenements to the south.</p>
